## Monster and Player Character Equivalence

The following table shows the approximate combat equivalence between monster challenge ratings (CR) and player character levels. For example, a CR 1 monster is roughly equivalent to a 3rd-level player character in combat. Similarly, if a CR 1 monster is a spellcaster, it is likely a 3rd-level spellcaster.

## Custom Monster Table

The following table shows the typical statistics of monsters of various challenge ratings. As usual, follow the guidelines in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* when customizing monsters.

Abbreviations:

- **CR:** Challenge rating of the monster.
- **XP:** Experience points awarded for defeating a monster of this challenge rating.
- **Coins:** Coinage typically carried by a monster of this challenge rating. Not all monsters carry coinage on their person, but those that do can typically be expected to carry the listed amount.
- **Prof:** Proficiency bonus of all monsters of this challenge rating.
- **Ability Scores:** Typical ability score array for monsters of this challenge rating. A monster's actual ability score array can vary greatly from the listed array, but the highest ability score should never exceed the listed highest ability score, and the sum of all ability scores should roughly equal the sum of the listed ability scores.
- **AC:** Typical Armor Class for monsters of this challenge rating. Can vary substantially depending on the monster. Monsters with lower Armor Class typically have more hit points or a higher average damage per round, and vice-versa.
- **HP:** Typical hit points for monsters of this challenge rating. Can vary substantially depending on the monster. Monsters with fewer hit points typically have higher Armor Class or average damage per round, and vice-versa.
- **Atk:** Typical attack bonus for monsters of this challenge rating.
- **Save DC:** Typical saving throw Difficulty Class for the spells and effects of monsters of this challenge rating.
- **DpR:** Typical average damage per round for monsters of this challenge rating when all attacks hit and all effects trigger. Can vary substantially depending on the monster. Monsters with lower average damage per round typically have higher Armor Class or more hit points, and vice-versa.
