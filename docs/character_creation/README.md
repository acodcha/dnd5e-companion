### Starting Wealth

When you create your character, instead of receiving starting equipment and wealth from your 1st-level class and background, you can instead opt to receive coinage based solely on your 1st-level class and spend this coinage on equipment. When using this rule, you do not gain any starting equipment or wealth from your background.

| Class     |      Starting Wealth |
| :-------- | -------------------: |
| Artificer | 125 gp (5d4 × 10 gp) |
| Barbarian |  50 gp (2d4 × 10 gp) |
| Bard      | 125 gp (5d4 × 10 gp) |
| Cleric    | 125 gp (5d4 × 10 gp) |
| Druid     |  50 gp (2d4 × 10 gp) |
| Fighter   | 125 gp (5d4 × 10 gp) |
| Monk      |  25 gp (1d4 × 10 gp) |
| Paladin   | 125 gp (5d4 × 10 gp) |
| Ranger    | 125 gp (5d4 × 10 gp) |
| Rogue     | 100 gp (4d4 × 10 gp) |
| Sorcerer  |  75 gp (3d4 × 10 gp) |
| Warlock   | 100 gp (4d4 × 10 gp) |
| Wizard    | 100 gp (4d4 × 10 gp) |

In addition, when creating a replacement character at 2nd level or higher after a prior character died or was retired, gain additional starting wealth as per the following table. Gain this wealth in addition to your regular 1st level starting equipment and/or wealth. Consult the Game Master before gaining this additional starting wealth; the Game Master might judge that you are effectively one or more levels ahead or behind based on your adventuring party's progress at looting treasure in the campaign.

| Level | Starting Wealth |
| :---: | --------------: |
|  1st  |               – |
|  2nd  |         + 50 gp |
|  3rd  |         + 80 gp |
|  4th  |        + 140 gp |
|  5th  |        + 200 gp |
|  6th  |        + 310 gp |
|  7th  |        + 460 gp |
|  8th  |        + 700 gp |
|  9th  |      + 1,000 gp |
| 10th  |      + 1,500 gp |
| 11th  |      + 2,300 gp |
| 12th  |      + 3,500 gp |
| 13th  |      + 5,200 gp |
| 14th  |      + 7,800 gp |
| 15th  |     + 12,000 gp |
| 16th  |     + 16,000 gp |
| 17th  |     + 21,000 gp |
| 18th  |     + 26,000 gp |
| 19th  |     + 30,000 gp |
| 20th  |     + 33,000 gp |

### Accumulated Wealth

The following table lists the total accumulated wealth of a character at the start of each given level, in addition to their regular 1st level starting equipment and wealth. This wealth may be in the form of coinage, gemstones, art objects, equipment, magic items, or any combination thereof. This wealth is obtained by receiving quest rewards, looting monsters' coinage, and finding treasure hoards while adventuring. For example, a character at the beginning of 6th level can be expected to have accumulated a total of 1,100 gp in addition to their regular 1st-level starting equipment and wealth.

This table may also be used when creating characters for a campaign that begins at a level greater than 1st. For example, if starting a campaign at 11th level, each character should start with 7,500 gp in addition to their regular 1st-level starting equipment and wealth.

| Level | Accumulated Wealth |
| :---: | -----------------: |
|  1st  |                  – |
|  2nd  |            + 80 gp |
|  3rd  |           + 200 gp |
|  4th  |           + 370 gp |
|  5th  |           + 650 gp |
|  6th  |         + 1,100 gp |
|  7th  |         + 1,800 gp |
|  8th  |         + 2,600 gp |
|  9th  |         + 3,800 gp |
| 10th  |         + 5,300 gp |
| 11th  |         + 7,500 gp |
| 12th  |        + 11,000 gp |
| 13th  |        + 15,000 gp |
| 14th  |        + 20,000 gp |
| 15th  |        + 28,000 gp |
| 16th  |        + 39,000 gp |
| 17th  |        + 55,000 gp |
| 18th  |        + 75,000 gp |
| 19th  |       + 100,000 gp |
| 20th  |       + 140,000 gp |

- Your height is your base height plus your height modifier in inches.
- Obtain your weight modifier by rolling the appropriate dice and multiplying by your height modifier.
- Your weight is your base weight plus your weight modifier in pounds.
